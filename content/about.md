### Introduction
Hi, my name is Frank, welcome to my personal website. I am a network engineer based in Nuremberg, Germany. My expertise lies in networking, primarily Cisco, as well as Automation via Ansible. Currently branching into more of a DevOps role with a focus on Kubernetes.

You can find links to my socials/GitHub in the menu bar.

This website was built to test Hugo.
